    <h1>Fishing Page</h1>
    <p>I find freshwater and saltwater fishing to be very relaxing. 
      Whether I am <strong>fishing</strong> the lakes in the mountains, rivers in the valley
      or on a <a href="https://www.californiabeaches.com/northern/mendocino-county/fort-bragg/" 
      title="Fort Bragg Beach">beach</a> in the ocean I enjoy it. The <strong>tranquility</strong> 
      of being outside and beautiful scenery makes the trip <strong>enjoyable</strong>. Fishing with family, 
      friends or by yourself relieves the <strong>stresses</strong> of every day life.</p>
